# Java_NOSql_Embedded_Database_Architecture
Here is a Library to impliment In- application/memory database (Embedded Database System) for Java 

SQL is something many developers (Hackers) know. In this world of SQL Based attacks, shift to a more In-app Data management architecture to keep the data in a single compute + Storage optimised server. No one can touch your data even if they have total access to your application server. In order to view, extract and alter data from this architecture, one needs all sorts of class files which can be custom designed to avoid illegal de-serialisation.
